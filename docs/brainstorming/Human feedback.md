Human feedback



merrick:

    don't over theorise, you made svd steering, a loss to separate two vectors within coherence and monotonic constraints. and it changes the score on morality tests more than prompting and steering
    what if we change the largest SVD direction and remove it
    don't use truthfullness as it's hard to show as it's saturated and debatable and effects everything. Show it on sycophancy, or long dashes. (or one of the other moral dimensions like ambition or optimism or tradition)
